First homework for 18spring

Starting on April 14, Saturday at 12:45 pm. I'll create a template class for the container vector. As required, it must work with integers, doubles and strings.

I have started working with the untemplated_vector.cpp to see if it works. Once I see how it works, I'll start on a templated_vector.h file. I'll begin by replacing all the 'double' keywords with T and place all the functions inside the template T.

Next up is working with driver for integers. This requires me to overload a few operators (comparision and arithmetic operators).

Once this is done, solving problems for the driver for double shouldn't be that big of a problem.

Integrating with string driver would require me to lookup the rules for specializing template since I can't remember the syntax. Shouldn't be difficult.
